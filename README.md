# Math is Punk

> Maths is rebellion. Because the world wants you to stop thinking.

**Math is Punk** is a pointless, over-engineered math-art playground.
It's not about teaching mathematics. It's about making it look and feel cool again.

Planned components:
- A visual maths playground (chaotic attractors, prime spirals, fractals).
- A daily "Today in Mathematics" drop.
- A Useless Calculator that refuses to calculate.
- Contrarian posters and absurd proofs.

This repo will evolve in phases.  
**Current phase:** Phase 0 — Naming & Setup (domain, deployment pipeline, skeleton UI).
